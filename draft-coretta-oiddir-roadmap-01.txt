1.  Introduction

   This ID series combines relevant components of ITU-T Recommendations
   [X.500], [X.660], [X.680], [RFC4510] and many others to define models
   and procedures of the "OID Directory" construct.

   The "OID Directory" is the X.500/LDAP facility for managing the "OID
   tree" -- in part or in whole -- in the context of OID Registration
   Authority operations, whether public or private.

   Additionally, unofficial components have been devised or appropriated
   specifically to aid adopters in overcoming various feasibility and
   logistical challenges that may arise during an implementation.

   This ID series OBSOLETES all revisions of 'draft-coretta-x660-ldap'
   (X660LDAP).  See Section 1.1 for details.

   This ID series -- as a whole -- is EXPERIMENTAL.  Implementations of
   any component set forth within this series SHOULD NOT manifest EXCEPT
   for any testing or proof-of-concept efforts.

Internet-Draft        The OID Directory: Roadmap             August 2024


1.1.  Relation to 'draft-coretta-x660-ldap'

   This ID was first published towards the end of 2020 under the formal
   name 'draft-coretta-x660-ldap' (X660LDAP) and had reached nine (9)
   revisions.  It originally held the title:

      "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Procedures and
       Schema Definitions for the Storage of X.660 Registration
       Information"

   Subsequent community feedback -- although generally favorable --
   suggested that some of the proposed subject matter was external to
   the core precepts of ITU-T Rec. [X.660], which confused some readers.

   Eventually, it was decided this document should be re-submitted with
   a more generalized title. This single change satisfied nearly all
   instances of criticism while preserving the intended spirit of the
   ID without misleading readers as it relates to the true scope of
   relevant standards.

   Furthermore, it was decided that, due to the overall breadth and
   complexity of the standards proposed, the ID should be divided into
   multiple supporting IDs in a more focused manner.  This has the
   secondary effect of allowing potential extensions of this concept
   in the future to be set forth in a more modular manner.

   Aside from the correction of typographical and formatting errors
   previously identified, the following additional changes have been
   made to the new ID(s):

     - Collective Attribute [RFC3671] support within this ID series is
       now more well-defined.

     - Administrative procedures and considerations have been expanded
       throughout many areas of the ID series.

     - The scope of potential candidates for adoption of the ID series
       has been expanded in Section 1.4.

     - Added new schema definitions and optimized several existing
       definitions within the RASCHEMA ID.

     - A short list of alternative solutions to this ID series has been
       added in Section 1.5.

     - The status of the ID is 'Experimental' (prev. 'Standards Track').

     - Citations and references now favor current editions of certain
       ITU-T Recommendations of relevance.

     - Author's physical address has reduced specificity.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in
   all capitals, as shown here.

   The convention "ID series" describes the entire suite of IDs which
   constitute the overall philosophy of the "OID Directory".  The term
   implies not only those IDs cited in Section 2, but also any future
   IDs that may be submitted as extensions by any author.

   The convention "OID tree" describes the hypothetical data structure
   that houses or represents all known public or private registrations
   that have ever been allocated.

1.3.  Acronyms Used

   The "OID Directory" ID series makes reference to many acronyms, each
   of which are defined as follows:

1.4.  Intended Audience

   This ID series will be most useful to an RA of any context, whether
   public or private.  This was, and shall always be, the primary goal
   of this effort.

   Other potential candidates include, but are not limited to:

     - Hardware manufacturers
     - Weather Services
     - Major internet technology companies
     - Internet Service Providers
     - Military/Allied directories
     - Healthcare service providers
     - Mainstream directory software product maintainers/vendors
     - ASN.1 professionals, particularly developers tasked with
       maintaining certain types of encoders and decoders

   Sufficed to say, any entity or individual that directly queries or
   uses ASN.1 object identifier information in frequent or critical
   fashion may be a candidate for this ID series.

1.5.  Alternatives

   Alternatives to this ID series include, but are not limited to:

     - Implementation of ORS, per [X.672]
     - Use of proprietary end-user applications
     - Use of third party OID registration authority websites
     - Reference raw ASN.1 definitions or relevant standards
     - Implementation of a custom, in-house solution

1.6.  Allocations

   This ID series has been allocated the following numeric OID prefix:

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.101

   Other IDs in this series extend this registration further.

Internet-Draft        The OID Directory: Roadmap             August 2024


   Should this ID series be elevated to RFC status, the aforementioned
   OID prefix shall be rendered obsolete in favor of an IANA-assigned
   OID, at which point this ID series will be updated to reference the
   literal 'IANA-ASSIGNED-OID' placeholder prefix where appropriate.

1.7.  Key Citations and Generalizations

   Certain constructs and operations are cited frequently throughout
   this ID series, each of which are covered below.

   Generalized phrasing is meaningful only within the bounds of this ID
   series and only where specificity is not relevant in context.

   The DAP Modify Operation is defined in clause 12.3 of ITU-T Rec.
   X.511.  The LDAP Modify Operation is defined in Section 4.6 of
   [RFC4511].  The term "Modify Operation" is used to describe either
   of these operations.

   The DAP Modify DN Operation is defined in clause 12.4 of ITU-T Rec.
   X.511.  The LDAP Modify DN Operation is defined within Section 4.9
   of [RFC4511].  The term "Modify DN Operation" is used to describe
   either of these operations.

   The DAP Search Operation is defined in clause 11.2 of ITU-T Rec.
   X.511.  The DAP List Operation, considered an alternative form of
   DAP Search, is defined in clause 11.1 of ITU-T Rec. X.511.   The
   LDAP Search Operation is defined in Section 4.5 of [RFC4511].  The
   term "Search Operation" is used to describe either DAP or LDAP Search
   Operations.  Similarly, "List Operation" is the term used to describe
   either the DAP List Operation or an LDAP Search Operation using the
   singleLevel scope.

   The DAP Read Operation is defined in clause 10.1 of ITU-T Rec. X.511.
   The term "Read Operation" is used to describe either this operation
   or a baseObject-scoped LDAP Search Operation.

   The DAP Remove Entry Operation is defined in clause 12.2 of ITU-T
   Rec. X.511.  The LDAP Delete Operation is defined in Section 4.8 of
   [RFC4511].  The term "Delete Operation" is used to describe either
   of these operations.

   The DAP Add Entry Operation is defined in clause 12.1 of ITU-T Rec.
   X.511.  The LDAP Add Operation is defined within Section 4.7 of
   [RFC4511].  The term "Add Operation" is used to describe either
   of these operations.

   The DAP SearchArgumentData.subset parameter is defined in clause
   11.2.1 of ITU-T Rec. X.511.  The LDAP SearchRequest.scope parameter
   is defined in Section 4.5.1 of [RFC4511].  The terms "scope" and
   "scoped" describe either of these components in the context of a
   "Search Operation".

Internet-Draft        The OID Directory: Roadmap             August 2024


   The DAP EntryInformationSelection ASN.1 SET is defined in clause 7.6
   of ITU-T Rec. X.511.  The LDAP SearchRequest.attributeSelector is
   defined in Section 4.5.1.8 in [RFC4511].  The terms "selection" and
   "selector" describe either of these components in the context of
   refining the presentation of attribute types derived from entries
   obtained by way of the Search or Read Operations.

   The DAP EntryInformationSelection.infoTypes.attributeTypesOnly
   parameter is defined within clause 7.6 of ITU-T Rec. X.511.  The
   equivalent LDAP SearchRequest.typesOnly parameter is defined in
   Section 4.5.1 of [RFC4511].  The term 'typesOnly' refers to either
   of these constructs in the context of occluding values during the
   presentation of entries retrieved using Read or Search Operations.

   The concepts of DIT Content Rules, DIT Structure Rules and Name Forms
   are defined throughout Section 6 of ITU-T Rec. X.501 and in Section
   4.1 of [RFC4512].

   The term "Write Operation" is an informal term used within this ID
   series.  In context, it can be used to refer to any of "Modify DN",
   "Modify", "Add" and "Delete" operation generalizations defined above
   wherever specificity is not required.

   The root DSE is discussed in Section 5 of [RFC4512] and within clause
   23.4.2 of ITU-T Rec. X.501.

   The 'subschemaSubentry' is defined in Section 4.2 of [RFC4512].

   Collective attributes, including associated subtree and subentry
   mechanics -- including the 'subtreeSpecification' attribute type --
   are defined throughout [RFC3671], [RFC3672] and ITU-T Rec. X.501.

1.8.  Common Operations and Concepts

   The following subsections describe where the standard DAP and LDAP
   Operations itemized in Section 1.7 apply within this ID series, and
   in what manner.

   Not all Operations will necessarily have a direct correlation to any
   specific procedures set forth within this ID series.  For instance,
   none of the procedures have any specific associations with Extended,
   Bind or Unbind Operations defined within both ITU-T Rec. X.511 and
   RFC4511.

1.8.1.  Read and Search

   The Search and Read Operations are the most critical used within this
   ID series, regardless of the nature of implementation.





Coretta                Expires February 23, 2025                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        The OID Directory: Roadmap             August 2024


   The Read Operation is used to retrieve or "call" specific individual
   entries from the RA DIT.  This requires foreknowledge of the target
   DN, but is RECOMMENDED as standard procedure in the intended spirit
   of this ID series.  This operation should ONLY return either one (1)
   entry or none.

   The Search Operation is used to retrieve multiple entries within a
   request, typically in the context of a directory subtree.  Specific
   foreknowledge of the desired entries is not required, however input
   of SearchRequest (LDAP) or SearchArgumentData (DAP) will require
   added specificity in terms of the scope (LDAP) or subset (DAP) in
   use, the filter supplied, and other parameters such as a selector.

   The Search Operation is usually discouraged for use by end users
   unless baseObject-scoped.  Use in administratively-focused RA DUA
   implementations is acceptable.

   The following subsections cover relevant parameters extended by the
   SearchRequest and SearchArgumentData constructs.

1.8.1.1.  baseObject

   The baseObject parameter defined within the SearchRequest (LDAP) and
   SearchArgumentData constructs defines the Name of the targeted entry
   as a DN.

   There is no default value within the context of this ID series, as
   this will be influenced based on the activities of the RA DUA.

1.8.1.2.  scope and subset

   The scope of a Search Operation defines the depth of the intended
   operation in terms of 'baseObject' (0), 'singleLevel' (1) and
   'wholeSubtree' (2).

   The default scope or subset for the RA DUA SHOULD be 'baseObject'.
   This is analogous to the Read Operation.  The RA DUA MAY allow user
   override of this parameter when appropriate.

1.8.1.3.  typesOnly and attributeTypesOnly

   During the presentation of a retrieved entry, the specification of
   (LDAP) typesOnly or (DAP) attributeTypesOnly parameters results in
   the discarding of values.

   This is often desirable in cases where the presence of entries alone
   is the focus -- not their content.

1.8.1.4.  filter

   Use of a filter adds conditions to the successful matching of entries
   to be retrieved by way of the Read or Search Operations.

Coretta                Expires February 23, 2025                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        The OID Directory: Roadmap             August 2024


   Although generally not required of the user, certain procedures set
   forth in this ID require use of a filter, for example during a range
   check to be conducted prior to allocation of an OID.  Generally the
   RA DUA is expected to manage such activities.

   The RA DUA may allow user-defined statements to be used for routine
   or administrative operation, if appropriate.

1.8.1.5.  attribute selection

   The attribute selection parameters may be used to specify desired
   attribute types to be retrieved, if defined, as a result of a Read
   or Search Operation upon an entry.

   Use of a selector by the RA DUA in virtually all cases is STRONGLY
   RECOMMENDED.

   The RA DUA MAY allow user-defined overrides, such as '+', '*', '1.1'
   or explicit attribute type descriptions if appropriate in context.

1.8.2.  Modify

   The Modify Operation is usually among the lesser-used operations in
   the terms of this ID series.

   Aside from unusual or extraordinary circumstances, 'registration'
   entries themselves are not typically edited.

   'registrant' entries, however, may be prone to updates, as they will
   contain contact information -- such as email addresses and telephone
   numbers -- for the respective authority.

   The nature of this ID series does not impose any particular practice
   or recommended procedure relating to the Modify Operation itself.

   Modification operations, in general, SHOULD be limited to authorized
   personnel or the respective "owners" of certain 'registration' and/or
   'registrant' entries as deemed appropriate.

1.8.3.  Add

   The Add Operation is used for the creation of new 'registration' or
   'registrant' entries.

   Generally this operation would be conducted by either the owner of
   the respective allocation, or the RA administrative personnel in the
   event the RA DSA supports this operation.

   The addition of new 'registration' entries MUST ONLY occur below the
   appropriate 'rARegistrationBase' value.  Similarly, the addition of
   new 'registrant' entries MUST ONLY occur below the appropriate
   'rARegistrantBase' value.

Coretta                Expires February 23, 2025                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        The OID Directory: Roadmap             August 2024


   RA DUAs MUST observe the MAY and MUST clauses of the object class
   definitions within Section 2.5 of the RASCHEMA ID.  These provide
   a rough inventory of the absolute minimum requirements for entry
   composition, as well as the OPTIONAL types available for use.

   The RA DUA MUST be prepared to observe additional restrictions or
   extensions that may be imposed through the use of DIT Content Rules,
   DIT Structure Rules and Name Forms held by the RA DSA.  This will
   influence the content of entries as well as the entry's DN structure.

1.8.4.  Delete

   The Delete Operation is among the least-used operations within the
   terms of this ID series.

   'registration' entries themselves are generally not deleted outright,
   especially when public-facing.  Any given 'registration' entry SHOULD
   be labeled as OBSOLETE, DEALLOCATED or some other such designation of
   non-operation and left intact indefinitely.  The act of deleting a
   'registration' entry directly is often discouraged outside of unusual
   or extraordinary circumstances, and may have disastrous consequences
   if executed in cavalier fashion.

   The same point may or may not apply to 'registrant' entries.  Given
   the costs associated with modern storage options, RAs may not deem it
   worthwhile to preserve so-called orphaned 'registrant' entries -- in
   other words, 'registrant' entries not currently serving in authority
   for any registrations.  Use of the Delete Operation may be indicated.

   This ID series makes no recommendation on the proper usage of the
   Delete Operation by appropriate personnel in the event of unusual or
   extraordinary circumstances.  Beyond purely administrative concerns,
   RA DUA adopters are STRONGLY ADVISED to consider the specifics of
   how and when deletion support should or should not be supported.

1.8.5.  Modify DN

   The Modify DN Operation is likely the least-used operation within the
   terms of this ID series.

   Aside from unrelated administrative uses of this operation, such as
   an effort to "move" entries from "ou=OIDs,o=rA" into a newly created
   context "ou=Registrations,o=rA", or for the correction of a bogus DN,
   the Modify DN operation is not indicated within the ID series.

2. Supporting IDs

   The following subsections each identify and describe various IDs
   that comprise and support this proposed standard as a whole.

   Should any of these IDs be updated or revised in any way, the highest
   revision number supersedes any previous revision.
