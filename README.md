## OID Directory Internet-Drafts Repository

This repository contains multiple documents, each in service of the overall OID Directory philosophy.

The "OID Directory" I-D series is EXPERIMENTAL and should NOT be used in mission-critical implementations.

It obsoletes the entirety of X660LDAP (draft-coretta-x660-ldap).
